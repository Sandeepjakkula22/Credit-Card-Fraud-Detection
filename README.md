# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. We utilize a dataset containing real transaction data with numerical features and a class label indicating fraud or legitimate transactions. The model helps identify fraudulent transactions early, reducing financial losses.
